# this monitors the network for connectivity with a fixed server,
# whose IP must be installed as part of the system setup. It is
# in /boot/serverip. If you do not do this, it will typically NOT
# fail; it will synthesize a `server' IP from your own, by replacing the
# host id in your IP with 1: thus for 192.168.1.23, the server becomes
# 102.168.1.1, which usually is a router and is so OK.
# 
# MUCH of this stuff depends on parsing the output of ifconfig, so
# if you are foolish enough to update the system, it will all break. Not
# my fault; you have been warned.
