Wheel commands:

linewheel *position* (1-5 or -1) 

    positions the line filterwheel to the given position or does
    a self-calibration sequence if position is given as -1

qthwheel *position* (1-5 or -1)
    
    positions the continuum filterwheel to the given position or
    does a self-calibration sequence if position is given as -1.

In order that the system knows which filterwheel is which, it is
necessary that they always be plugged into the same USB ports. The
line wheel must be plugged into the upper left port looking at the
face of the pi with the ethernet port on the far left. The QTH
filterwheel must be plugged into the lower left port,

ADC commands:

adcraw *port* (1 or 2)

    Echos the voltage on ADC port 1 or 2, which is about 50mV with no
    input. It is offset from zero because the opamp, ostensibly with
    rail-to-rail output, can only pull down to about 30 mV, and we offset
    it so that it is still linear with zero input.

adc *port* (1 or 2)

    Echos the voltage on ADC port 1 or 2 corrected for the offset, which
    must be calibrated for the supply voltage which generates the offset
    and for the photodiode dark current. This is done by

adccalib

    Which takes several readings and averages with the integrating sphere 
    dark (all lamps off) and saves it in two little files in the /boot 
    partition, adccalib1 and adccalib2. This is the only write activity 
    to the SD card in normal operation. This needs be done only occasionally, 
    but probably should be done at the beginning of every session. Since 
    it is necessary to turn the lamps off before executing it, it must be 
    executed by some upper-level software which also controls the lamps.
