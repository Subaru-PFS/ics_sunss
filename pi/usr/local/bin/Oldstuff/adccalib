# calibration routine for photodiodes for integrathing sphere.
# the PDS are Thor SM05P1B, anode-grounded devices which have
# a dark current of the order of 1 na. With a gain resistor of
# 5M, this is a signal of about 5 mv. The offset is Vdd/100,
# or about 50 mv. This routine determines the average dark signal,
# which is the sum of these. We use bc to do decimal arithmetic
# in bash.
